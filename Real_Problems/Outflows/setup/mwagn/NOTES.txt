# Milky way problem setup

## Using the McMillan potential

With best fit parameters, but Rm = 0 for HI, i.e. the central hole in HI filled.

# Thermodynamic parameters.
The hot phase temperature and density determine the porosity.


# Fractal cubes
kmin =  20
nx = 512
ny = 512
nz = 512
sigma = 10


# Masses.
Using this setup gives a total gas mass ~ ....
